# Item Booking Endpoint Table

| Endpoints                               | Method | Description                 |
|:----------------------------------------|:-------|:----------------------------|
| api/items                               | GET    | Get all items               |
| api/items/{id}                          | GET    | Get an item by ID           |
| api/items                               | POST   | Add a new item              |
| api/items/{id}                          | PUT    | Update an item              |
| api/items/{id}                          | DELETE | Delete an item              |
| api/items/{itemId}/students/{studentId} | PUT    | Assign an item to a student |
| api/items/populate                      | POST   | Populate the database       |

# Theoretical questions
* **3.3.3**: Why is PUT used for assigning an item to a student instead of POST?
  - PUT is an update, whereas POST is the same as creating something new. Since we just want to assign an item to a student and not create a completely new student, we use PUT.

# Security Endpoint Table
